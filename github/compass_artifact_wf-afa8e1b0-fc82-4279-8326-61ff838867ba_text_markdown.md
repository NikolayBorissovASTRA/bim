# GitHub Enterprise Analysis for ASTRA: Swiss Federal Roads Office

**GitHub Enterprise Cloud with EU data residency represents the optimal solution for ASTRA**, providing FedRAMP-authorized security, ISO 27001 certification, and Swiss data protection compliance at $21 per user monthly. For a 30-user deployment, the total first-year cost approximates $7,700 including Premium Support, scaling predictably to $21,500 annually at 70 users. The platform eliminates infrastructure overhead while delivering enterprise governance, advanced security scanning, and comprehensive audit capabilities required for Swiss federal institutions.

The combination of EU data residency (launched October 2024), SAML single sign-on, mandatory two-factor authentication, and GitHub Advanced Security features positions ASTRA to meet stringent Swiss Federal Data Protection Act requirements while accessing cutting-edge development tools. With proven deployment across 10,000+ government users worldwide—including UK Government Digital Service, US GSA, and NASA—GitHub Enterprise demonstrates mature government-readiness with dedicated support infrastructure and FedRAMP Tailored Authority to Operate certification.

## Current state of GitHub pricing for government institutions

GitHub structures its platform across five distinct tiers, with Enterprise Cloud emerging as the standard for government deployments requiring compliance certifications. The Free tier offers unlimited repositories but limits collaboration features to public repositories only, making it unsuitable for government work requiring confidentiality. Team tier at $4 per user monthly provides basic collaboration tools including protected branches and code owners, yet lacks the enterprise identity management and compliance certifications essential for federal institutions.

**Enterprise Cloud pricing stands at $21 per user monthly with significant volume available through annual commitments**. First-year annual contracts reduce effective monthly costs to $19.25 per user, representing an 8% discount that compounds over multi-year agreements. Enterprise Cloud uniquely includes 50,000 GitHub Actions minutes monthly versus 3,000 for Team tier, 50GB package storage versus 2GB, and critically for government use, provides FedRAMP Tailored authorization, SOC 2 Type 2 certification, and configurable data residency options.

Enterprise Server matches Enterprise Cloud pricing at $21 per user monthly but requires organizations to shoulder complete infrastructure costs, ongoing maintenance, and version upgrade management. While providing maximum data sovereignty through on-premises deployment, Server implementations typically demand dedicated DevOps staff and incur Azure/AWS hosting expenses ranging from $2,000-8,000 monthly depending on scale. The feature parity gap between Server and Cloud has widened, with Cloud receiving immediate access to GitHub Copilot, Codespaces, and Advanced Security enhancements while Server implementations lag 3-6 months behind.

**For ASTRA's projected user base, concrete annual costs break down as follows**: At 10 users, Enterprise Cloud costs $2,310 annually (first year) or $2,520 subsequently. Scaling to 30 users yields $6,930 first-year or $7,560 ongoing. At full 70-user deployment, total annual expenditure reaches $16,170 initially and $17,640 in subsequent years. These figures exclude Advanced Security add-ons, Premium Support packages, and training investments, which layer additional costs detailed in subsequent sections.

Negotiation leverage exists significantly at enterprise scale. Market intelligence indicates volume discounts of 15-40% become achievable for contracts exceeding 100 users, with multi-year commitments unlocking deeper reductions. The combination of GitHub Enterprise plus Advanced Security carries a $49 per active committer monthly list price, but bundled enterprise agreements frequently achieve 12-18% reductions through competitive positioning against GitLab Enterprise. For ASTRA's 30-70 user range, standard pricing applies with limited negotiation room, though Swiss government procurement frameworks may unlock public sector considerations.

## Security architecture and compliance framework

**GitHub achieved ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certification in May 2022, with updated certification including GitHub Copilot issued May 9, 2024**, demonstrating continuous investment in information security management systems meeting international standards. The platform maintains SOC 2 Type 2 attestation covering Trust Service Criteria for security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy, with reports available directly through enterprise administrator compliance settings. GitHub additionally holds SOC 1 Type 2 certification and publishes public SOC 3 reports, providing transparency into internal controls relevant for financial and operational auditing.

FedRAMP Tailored Authorization granted in 2018 positions GitHub Enterprise Cloud as pre-authorized for US federal government deployments, implementing NIST 800-53 controls appropriate for Low-Impact Software-as-a-Service systems. While ASTRA operates under Swiss rather than US federal jurisdiction, FedRAMP certification signals mature security processes and government-grade operational practices applicable across regulatory contexts. GitHub announced pursuit of FedRAMP Moderate authorization in 2024, targeting enhanced compliance for highly regulated industries, with existing LI-SaaS authorization remaining valid throughout the upgrade process.

**The October 29, 2024 launch of GitHub Enterprise Cloud with EU data residency fundamentally transforms compliance posture for European government institutions**. This capability stores repository data, code, issues, pull requests, wikis, Actions artifacts, and Packages at rest within Azure's Western Europe and Sweden regions, addressing data sovereignty requirements under GDPR and Swiss Federal Data Protection Act. Data residency implementations utilize the ghe.com namespace isolated from public github.com infrastructure, running on dedicated Enterprise Managed Users architecture where all user accounts originate from organizational identity providers rather than personal GitHub accounts.

Switzerland's EU adequacy decision and close regulatory alignment with GDPR means EU data residency effectively satisfies Swiss data protection requirements for most federal use cases. GitHub's comprehensive Data Protection Agreement incorporates Standard Contractual Clauses for Module 2 (Controller-to-Processor) and Module 3 (Processor-to-Processor) transfers, with explicit coverage of Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework for transatlantic data flows. The platform implements privacy by design principles including data minimization, regular Data Protection Impact Assessments, and Article 33-34 breach notification procedures compatible with Swiss FDPIC oversight requirements.

## Advanced Security capabilities and threat protection

GitHub restructured Advanced Security pricing effective April 1, 2025, unbundling capabilities into two standalone products priced per active committer rather than per seat. **GitHub Secret Protection costs $19 monthly per active committer**, delivering secret scanning across 200+ partner patterns including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and customizable organizational patterns. Push protection functionality blocks commits containing secrets before they enter repositories, preventing credential exposure at the source while maintaining delegated bypass processes for legitimate edge cases requiring governance approval.

The secret scanning engine now incorporates AI-powered detection identifying unstructured credentials and passwords beyond structured API keys, dramatically reducing false positives while catching human-readable secrets that pattern matching historically missed. Security campaigns enable organization-wide remediation initiatives, providing dashboards showing exposed secret distribution and enabling coordinated cleanup across hundreds of repositories. Delegated alert dismissal workflows ensure appropriate security team oversight before developers can mark detected secrets as false positives or acceptable risks.

**GitHub Code Security costs $30 monthly per active committer**, providing CodeQL semantic code analysis supporting 15+ programming languages with customizable query packs. The platform's SARIF upload integration allows consolidation of third-party static analysis tools into unified security dashboards, giving security teams single-pane visibility across diverse scanning technologies. Copilot Autofix, available for JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and Python, generates AI-powered remediation suggestions for 90% of detected vulnerability types, converting security findings into actionable pull requests developers can review and merge.

Dependency review functionality analyzes supply chain security during pull request workflows, surfacing newly introduced vulnerabilities before merge rather than discovering them post-deployment. Premium Dependabot features include automated security update pull requests with custom auto-triage rules, reducing manual vulnerability management overhead. Active committer billing counts users who committed to any repository with Advanced Security enabled within the prior 90 days, creating consumption-based pricing that scales naturally with actual usage rather than requiring upfront license commitments.

**For ASTRA's deployment scenario, Advanced Security represents significant additional investment**. Assuming 80% of users actively commit code (typical for development-focused teams), a 30-user deployment with 24 active committers would incur $456 monthly for Secret Protection alone, or $720 monthly for full Code Security, totaling $14,112 annually for comprehensive protection. At 70 users with 56 active committers, costs reach $1,064 monthly for Secret Protection or $1,680 for Code Security, approximating $20,160 annually for complete Advanced Security coverage. Organizations must evaluate whether preventing security incidents justifies this 50-100% premium over base Enterprise Cloud subscriptions.

## GitHub Actions compute resources and storage allocation

**GitHub Actions minutes consumption varies dramatically by operating system due to compute cost multipliers**. Linux runners consume minutes at face value with 1x multiplier, making them most economical for CI/CD workloads. Windows runners apply 2x multipliers, consuming two quota minutes for each actual execution minute, while macOS runners carry 10x multipliers due to Apple hardware licensing costs. A workflow executing 10 actual minutes on macOS depletes 100 minutes from organizational quotas, creating substantial cost implications for iOS/macOS development pipelines.

Enterprise Cloud includes 50,000 minutes monthly, vastly exceeding Team tier's 3,000 minute allocation and supporting approximately 833 hours of Linux compute or 83 hours of macOS builds. Organizations exceeding included quotas pay $0.008 per Linux minute, $0.016 per Windows minute, and $0.08 per macOS minute for overages. However, **self-hosted runners eliminate GitHub Actions consumption charges entirely** across all pricing tiers including Free, with organizations bearing only their own infrastructure costs for compute resources they provision and manage.

Storage limits for GitHub Packages and Actions artifacts differentiate tiers significantly. Free and Pro tiers provide merely 500MB-1GB, insufficient for modern artifact storage needs, while Team tier includes 2GB and Enterprise Cloud allocates 50GB. Artifact storage costs $0.008 per GB daily for overages, with data transfer billed at $0.0875 per GB bandwidth consumed. Actions artifacts automatically expire based on configurable retention periods (90 days default, maximum 400 days for Enterprise), while Packages persist indefinitely until explicitly deleted, requiring active lifecycle management to control storage consumption.

Concurrent job limits constrain pipeline throughput, with standard GitHub-hosted runners supporting 20 simultaneous jobs on Free tier, 40 on Pro, 60 on Team, and 500 on Enterprise Cloud. macOS concurrent job limits remain more restrictive at 5 for Free/Pro/Team and 50 for Enterprise due to hardware constraints. Larger runner instances available on Team and Enterprise tiers support up to 1,000 total concurrent jobs with dedicated quotas for GPU-accelerated workflows capped at 100 simultaneous jobs, enabling compute-intensive machine learning and graphics rendering pipelines.

**For government institutions requiring data sovereignty, self-hosted runners offer compelling advantages**. Organizations deploy runners on their own infrastructure—whether on-premises data centers, government cloud environments like AWS GovCloud, or Azure Government—maintaining complete control over execution environments and data flow. Self-hosted runners incur zero GitHub charges regardless of execution volume, with organizations paying only underlying infrastructure costs. This model suits air-gapped environments, compliance requirements mandating specific geographic compute locations, or high-volume CI/CD usage where cloud-hosted runner costs would become prohibitive.

## Enterprise identity management and access control

**SAML single sign-on integration provides centralized authentication for Enterprise Cloud deployments**, supporting any SAML 2.0 compliant identity provider including Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), Okta, PingFederate, PingIdentity, Active Directory Federation Services, and OneLogin. Enterprise-level SAML configuration enforces authentication across all organizations within the enterprise account, while organization-level SAML applies granularly to individual organizations. Both configurations support SP-initiated and IdP-initiated SSO flows, with configurable session durations from minimum 4-hour recommendations to 24-hour defaults.

Enterprise Managed Users represent the most restrictive identity model, mandating SAML authentication while creating all user accounts through identity provider provisioning rather than allowing users to maintain personal GitHub accounts. EMU deployments receive unique namespaces on ghe.com isolated from public github.com, preventing users from interacting with open source repositories or public collaboration spaces. This architecture suits highly regulated environments requiring absolute control over user identities and complete separation from public GitHub infrastructure, though it sacrifices access to the broader open source ecosystem that makes GitHub valuable for many development teams.

**SCIM 2.0 provisioning automates user lifecycle management**, synchronizing user accounts and group memberships between identity providers and GitHub. When administrators provision users in Entra ID or Okta, SCIM automatically creates corresponding GitHub accounts with appropriate organization and team memberships. Deprovisioning in the IdP immediately revokes GitHub access, ensuring former employees cannot access repositories after termination. Team synchronization maps IdP groups to GitHub teams, maintaining consistent access control policies across identity and collaboration platforms without manual reconciliation.

IP allow lists restrict network access to GitHub resources by IP address or CIDR range, enforceable at enterprise or organization level. Organizations configure allow lists specifying office networks, VPN egress points, and other approved locations, blocking access attempts from unauthorized networks even with valid credentials. GitHub Apps can define their own IP allow lists inherited into organization configurations, preventing third-party application blocking. Enterprise Managed Users alternatively leverage IdP Conditional Access Policies when using Microsoft Entra ID with OIDC authentication, deactivating GitHub's native IP allow list in favor of more granular IdP-managed network policies.

**Two-factor authentication enforcement became mandatory platform-wide for code contributors in March 2023**, with organization and enterprise administrators able to require 2FA for all members including outside collaborators. Supported authentication methods include TOTP authenticator apps (Authy, Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator), FIDO2/WebAuthn hardware security keys (YubiKey, Titan Security Key), passkeys leveraging biometric authentication (Touch ID, Face ID, Windows Hello), GitHub Mobile push notifications, and SMS text messages, though SMS represents the least secure option. Government deployments should mandate hardware security keys or TOTP for privileged users while disabling SMS authentication to meet higher security standards.

## Repository organization patterns for government digital artifacts

**Government institutions benefit from single-organization architecture rather than proliferating multiple organizations for different departments**. A unified ASTRA organization promotes cross-departmental collaboration, simplifies access management, and maintains consistent security policies across all repositories. Team-based access control provides sufficient granularity for different projects and departments without organizational fragmentation. Only situations requiring fundamentally different compliance postures—such as separating unclassified from classified work—justify multiple organization structures.

Repository naming conventions establish findable, predictable patterns across hundreds or thousands of repositories. The format `[department]-[project]-[type]` creates clear taxonomy, exemplified by `roads-digital-transform-docs`, `admin-policy-templates`, or `infrastructure-monitoring-api`. Documentation repositories follow `docs-[category]` patterns like `docs-architecture`, `docs-security-policies`, or `docs-processes`. Type suffixes distinguish implementation from documentation, with `-web`, `-api`, `-cli`, or `-infrastructure` indicating application repositories versus `-docs`, `-templates`, or `-guides` for knowledge artifacts.

**Repository visibility should default to Internal for most government work**, balancing transparency with appropriate confidentiality. Internal repositories remain visible to all organization members while hidden from public view, enabling cross-departmental collaboration without external exposure. Public repositories suit general documentation, open-source tools, published APIs, and content intended for citizen transparency. Private repositories restrict access to specific teams, appropriate for security-sensitive systems, personally identifiable information, classified documents, or pre-release project work. Internal visibility strikes optimal balance for standard government operations requiring collaboration but not public disclosure.

Repository structure templates ensure consistency across projects. Documentation repositories contain `.github/CODEOWNERS` defining approval requirements, pull request templates guiding contributors, workflow automation for validation, and organized directories for policies, processes, templates, and architecture documentation. Code repositories include source directories, comprehensive test suites, inline documentation, README files explaining purpose and setup, CONTRIBUTING.md establishing collaboration guidelines, SECURITY.md defining vulnerability disclosure processes, and LICENSE files clarifying usage rights for open source components.

## Branch protection rules and peer review workflows

**Branch protection rules enforce quality gates preventing direct commits to critical branches like main or production**. Recommended configuration for government documentation repositories requires pull requests before merging, mandating minimum two approvals including at least one code owner review. Stale review dismissal ensures new commits invalidate previous approvals, requiring re-review of changed content. Status checks must pass before merge, integrating automated validation, security scanning, documentation linting, and CI/CD pipelines into quality enforcement.

Conversation resolution requirements ensure all pull request comments receive explicit resolution, preventing overlooked feedback or unaddressed concerns. Signed commit enforcement provides non-repudiation for audit trails, with GPG or S/MIME cryptographic signatures verifying commit authenticity and author identity. Linear history requirements (optional but recommended) prevent complex merge graphs, maintaining clean chronological progression. Administrator enforcement prevents even organization owners from bypassing rules, eliminating privileged backdoors that undermine governance controls.

**CODEOWNERS files automate reviewer assignment based on file paths and patterns**, residing in `.github/CODEOWNERS` at repository root. Syntax supports wildcard patterns where `*` assigns global reviewers, `/docs/` targets documentation directories, and `*.md` matches all Markdown files. More specific patterns override general rules through hierarchical evaluation, so `/docs/security/` can require security team review while `/docs/` defaults to documentation team. Patterns like `/policies/ @org/legal-team @org/compliance-team` ensure multiple teams review sensitive content, with ANY ONE team member able to approve rather than requiring unanimous consent.

Team-based ownership proves more maintainable than individual assignments. Rather than listing `@alice @bob @carol`, specify `@org/documentation-team` so membership changes automatically reflect in review requirements without CODEOWNERS file updates. Team members must hold write access to repositories they own since GitHub requires code owners to possess sufficient permissions for approvals. Documentation should accompany CODEOWNERS files explaining ownership rationale and escalation paths for disputed reviews.

Pull request templates standardize submission quality, prompting authors to describe changes, explain rationale, document testing approaches, and complete review checklists. Templates include sections for security impact assessment on sensitive changes, ensuring appropriate evaluation of content visibility, data handling, and access control modifications. Automated reviewer assignment through CODEOWNERS, combined with explicit approval requirements and status checks, creates comprehensive review workflows ensuring documentation accuracy, policy compliance, and knowledge sharing across government teams.

## Branching strategies and merge methodologies

**GitHub Flow offers optimal simplicity for government documentation and web applications requiring continuous deployment**. This strategy maintains main as perpetually deployable, with all development occurring on short-lived feature branches. Developers create branches from main, make changes, open pull requests triggering automated review and testing, merge to main after approval, and immediately deploy merged changes. Branch deletion after merge prevents accumulation of stale references.

GitHub Flow's strengths include minimal complexity reducing learning curve, fast feedback cycles encouraging small incremental changes, natural support for continuous deployment, and clear process requiring no release branch management overhead. The approach falters for applications supporting multiple production versions simultaneously or requiring extended stabilization periods before release. Documentation repositories and modern web applications rarely face these constraints, making GitHub Flow ideal for most government digital transformation initiatives.

**GitFlow provides structured release management through multiple long-lived branches**: main mirrors production state, develop integrates ongoing work, feature/* branches isolate new functionality, release/* branches stabilize upcoming versions, and hotfix/* branches address urgent production issues. This complexity suits scheduled release cadences, large teams with parallel workstreams, formal testing and QA phases, and products maintaining multiple versions in production. The cost comes in increased merge conflict likelihood, slower integration cycles, and substantial process overhead inappropriate for agile documentation workflows.

Trunk-based development pushes simplicity further than GitHub Flow, maintaining single trunk/main branch with extremely short-lived feature branches lasting hours rather than days. Developers integrate to trunk multiple times daily, using feature flags to hide incomplete functionality from users. This approach minimizes merge conflicts, supports continuous integration prerequisites, and maintains pristine linear history. However, it demands mature CI/CD infrastructure, comprehensive automated testing, feature flag management discipline, and experienced development teams comfortable with continuous integration practices. Organizations should adopt trunk-based development only after mastering simpler branching strategies.

**For ASTRA, GitHub Flow represents recommended baseline** across documentation repositories and most software projects. Squash and merge strategy converts all feature branch commits into single logical commits on main, creating clean history where each commit represents complete features or documentation updates rather than granular work-in-progress snapshots. This approach enables easy feature reversion if issues arise post-merge, simplifies git bisect debugging, and produces comprehensible history for future maintainers. Reserve merge commits for complex features where preserving detailed development history provides archaeological value.

## Deployment options: Enterprise Server versus Enterprise Cloud

**GitHub Enterprise Server provides maximum data sovereignty through self-hosted deployment** on organizational infrastructure, whether on-premises data centers, private cloud environments, or government cloud platforms like Azure Government. Organizations control physical server locations, network configurations, backup procedures, and data retention policies without depending on GitHub's hosting decisions. Air-gapped deployments fully isolate Enterprise Server from internet connectivity, meeting highest security requirements for classified work or adversarial threat models.

This sovereignty costs significant operational overhead. Enterprise Server requires dedicated infrastructure—minimum Standard_E4_v3 virtual machine equivalents even for small deployments—incurring hosting expenses from $2,000-8,000 monthly depending on scale and redundancy. Organizations must manage version upgrades typically released quarterly, schedule maintenance windows, implement backup and disaster recovery, monitor system health, and troubleshoot issues without cloud platform abstraction. DevOps teams familiar with Enterprise Server estimate 0.5-1.0 FTE ongoing to maintain production deployments.

**Feature parity gaps between Server and Cloud have widened substantially**. Enterprise Server receives feature releases 3-6 months after Enterprise Cloud, with some capabilities like GitHub Codespaces, Copilot Enterprise features, and certain Advanced Security enhancements remaining Cloud-exclusive. The GitHub Actions runner ecosystem targets Cloud infrastructure first, with Server implementations requiring additional validation and configuration. Organizations choosing Server must accept feature lag as sovereignty cost.

GitHub Connect bridges Server and Cloud for hybrid deployments, establishing secure HTTPS connections from Server to Cloud without exposing Server to public internet. Connected instances synchronize license usage, enable unified contribution graphs showing Server activity on Cloud profiles, provide unified search across environments, access GitHub Advisory Database for Dependabot alerts, and utilize GitHub.com Actions in Server workflows. However, GitHub Connect does NOT transmit repositories, issues, or pull requests to Cloud, maintaining Server data isolation while enabling selective integration.

**Enterprise Cloud with EU data residency eliminates most Server advantages for European government institutions** while preserving Cloud benefits. Data resides in Azure's Western Europe and Sweden regions meeting geographic sovereignty requirements, runs on ghe.com namespace isolated from public GitHub infrastructure, and operates under Enterprise Managed Users enforcing organizational identity control. ASTRA gains automatic updates, immediate feature access, zero infrastructure management, comprehensive Copilot integration, and reduced operational cost compared to Server self-hosting. Unless ASTRA requires air-gapped deployment or on-premises control for classified work, Enterprise Cloud with EU residency represents superior choice.

## Data residency architecture and Swiss compliance alignment

The October 29, 2024 launch of GitHub Enterprise Cloud with Data Residency marks pivotal advancement for European government adoption. **All repository data including source code, commit history, issues, pull requests, wikis, Actions artifacts, and Packages rests at Azure Western Europe and Sweden regions**, subject to Microsoft's enterprise-grade encryption in transit and at rest. The ghe.com namespace isolates data residency deployments from public github.com infrastructure, running on dedicated multi-tenant SaaS architecture rather than shared infrastructure.

Enterprise Managed Users requirements ensure all user accounts originate from organizational identity providers rather than personal GitHub accounts, preventing uncontrolled data access. Users authenticate exclusively via SAML SSO, with SCIM provisioning managing account lifecycle. This architecture prevents users from transferring organizational code to personal accounts, forking repositories to external locations, or collaborating with public GitHub users, creating hard boundaries around sensitive government code.

**Switzerland's EU adequacy decision granted December 2023 under Article 45 GDPR confirms Swiss data protection standards as essentially equivalent to EU requirements**, enabling free data flows between Switzerland and EU member states. Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (revDPA) effective September 1, 2023 harmonizes closely with GDPR on core principles: lawful basis for processing, data minimization, purpose limitation, storage limitation, integrity and confidentiality, accountability, and data subject rights. EU data residency therefore satisfies Swiss regulatory requirements for most government use cases not involving classified information.

GitHub's Data Protection Agreement explicitly addresses Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework certification, implements Standard Contractual Clauses for Module 2 and Module 3 transfers, includes UK GDPR Addendum for post-Brexit compliance, and provides comprehensive coverage of data subject rights under Article 15-22 GDPR. The platform supports access requests, rectification, erasure (right to be forgotten), data portability, objection to processing, and restriction of processing. Data breach notification procedures comply with Article 33-34 GDPR's 72-hour reporting requirements for supervisory authorities and affected individuals.

Swiss Federal Data Protection Commissioner (FDPIC) oversight mechanisms remain compatible with GitHub's compliance framework. The platform maintains comprehensive data processing records required under Article 30 GDPR equivalent provisions, conducts regular Data Protection Impact Assessments for high-risk processing, implements privacy by design and default, and designates data protection officers. **For ASTRA as Swiss federal institution, Enterprise Cloud with EU residency combined with GitHub's DPA and SCCs satisfies regulatory requirements** absent specific mandate for on-premises hosting or classified information handling.

## Audit logging and continuous compliance monitoring

**GitHub Enterprise Cloud captures comprehensive audit events across user authentication, organization changes, repository modifications, system configuration, and Git operations**. User events track authentication successes and failures, profile changes, two-factor authentication modifications, personal access token creation and usage, and OAuth application authorizations. Organization events record member additions and removals, role changes, team modifications, billing updates, and settings changes. Repository events log access grants, branch protection modifications, collaborator management, and repository creation or deletion.

Git events including push, pull, clone, and fetch operations receive 7-day retention by default due to storage volume, with organizations configuring audit log streaming to external systems for extended retention. Security events encompass secret scanning alert creation and dismissal, code scanning results, Dependabot actions, and Advanced Security configuration changes. API events capture all programmatic access when enabled, providing complete visibility into automation and integration activity.

**Audit log retention extends to 6 months for most events through web UI and API**, sufficient for many compliance requirements but inadequate for government audit trails demanding multi-year retention. Audit log streaming addresses this limitation by continuously forwarding events to external SIEM platforms, log management systems, or data lakes. GitHub natively integrates with Splunk, Azure Event Hubs, and Datadog, plus supports direct writes to AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage. Streaming maintains 7-day buffer preventing data loss if downstream systems temporarily unavailable.

Organizations access audit logs through web interface at Enterprise or Organization Settings → Audit Log, supporting search queries filtering by creation date, actor, action, organization, repository, and other dimensions. API endpoints enable programmatic access for automated compliance reporting, with rate limits permitting substantial query volume. One-time exports generate JSON or CSV files for offline analysis, point-in-time reporting, or regulatory submissions. IP address logging (optional configuration) enriches audit trails with network location data for access pattern analysis.

**For ASTRA, audit log streaming to existing Swiss government SIEM infrastructure represents critical compliance control**. Real-time event forwarding ensures central security operations center visibility into GitHub activity, enables correlation with other government system logs for threat detection, satisfies records retention requirements exceeding GitHub's 6-month limitation, and supports forensic investigation during security incidents. Configuration should stream all event types to maximize audit trail completeness, with SIEM applying appropriate retention policies based on Swiss government archival requirements.

## Cost modeling for ASTRA across growth scenarios

**At current 10-user scale, Enterprise Cloud costs $2,310 annually with first-year discount** ($19.25 per user monthly), rising to $2,520 in subsequent years ($21 per user monthly). This baseline excludes Advanced Security, Premium Support, and training investments. Adding Secret Protection for 8 active committers (assuming 80% commit rate) costs additional $1,824 annually, while full Code Security increases by $2,880 annually. Premium Support at negotiated 18% adds approximately $416 to base subscription, totaling $3,740 first year with support but without Advanced Security.

**Scaling to 30 users typical of current ASTRA operations yields $6,930 first-year Enterprise Cloud subscription** or $7,560 ongoing. Premium Support increases to $1,361 annually at 18% rate. Secret Protection for 24 active committers costs $5,472 yearly, with Code Security at $8,640 annually. Realistic first-year total with Enterprise Cloud, Premium Support, and Code Security reaches $16,971, dropping to $17,561 in subsequent years. Training investment of $10,000-15,000 in year one pushes first-year total to $27,000-32,000 amortizing across subsequent years.

**Full 70-user deployment costs $16,170 annually first year or $17,640 ongoing for Enterprise Cloud subscription alone**. Premium Support at scale (18% negotiated rate) adds $3,175 annually. Advanced Security becomes substantial: Secret Protection for 56 active committers costs $12,768 yearly, while full Code Security reaches $20,160 annually. Enterprise Cloud plus Premium Support plus Code Security totals $41,000 yearly. Organizations this size warrant Premium Plus Support including dedicated Customer Reliability Engineer, quarterly health checks, and 12 technical advisory hours per quarter, increasing support costs to approximately 22% or $3,881 annually but including $5,000 value annual training.

**Self-hosted runner deployment eliminates Actions compute charges**, critical consideration for organizations with high CI/CD volume or existing government cloud infrastructure. ASTRA could provision runners on Swiss government cloud or on-premises infrastructure, consuming zero GitHub Actions minutes while maintaining complete control over execution environments and data flow. Infrastructure costs depend on deployment model—Azure Government virtual machines, AWS GovCloud instances, or physical servers—but typically prove economical for organizations exceeding 50,000 included Enterprise Cloud minutes monthly or requiring air-gapped environments.

Negotiation opportunities exist primarily at enterprise scale exceeding 100 users or multi-year commitments. Market intelligence suggests 15-40% discounts achievable on combined Enterprise plus Advanced Security at scale, with specific leverage from competitive GitLab Enterprise positioning. ASTRA's 30-70 user range falls below typical negotiation thresholds, though public sector procurement frameworks or Swiss government blanket agreements may unlock considerations unavailable through standard commercial channels. Organizations should engage GitHub's government sales team directly rather than general commercial sales for access to public sector specialists understanding Swiss federal procurement.

## Training and enablement for 30-70 government users

**GitHub Skills provides completely free self-paced training** through skills.github.com, delivering interactive hands-on courses within actual GitHub repositories guided by automated bot instructions. Core learning paths cover First Day on GitHub (Introduction to GitHub, Markdown communication, GitHub Pages), First Week on GitHub (pull request reviews, merge conflict resolution, release workflows, Codespaces, Copilot), GitHub Actions automation (CI workflows, package publishing, reusable workflows), and Security topics (repository supply chain, secret scanning, CodeQL introduction). Each course requires 30-90 minutes, enabling users to develop foundational skills without training budget expenditure.

Microsoft Learn extends free training through learn.microsoft.com/training/github/, offering learning paths preparing users for GitHub Certifications including GitHub Foundations, GitHub Actions, GitHub Advanced Security, and GitHub Administration. Module-based structure permits flexible learning, with users completing prerequisites before advanced topics. This combination of GitHub Skills and Microsoft Learn provides comprehensive self-paced curriculum sufficient for majority of users, reserving instructor-led training for key stakeholders and administrators.

**GitHub Expert Services delivers professional instructor-led training** customized for organizational needs, with 4-6 week lead time for scheduling and material customization. Core offerings include GitHub for Developers (hands-on practical training building team confidence), GitHub for Non-Developers (extending GitHub to project managers and stakeholders), GitHub Admin Training for Enterprise Cloud (configuration and maintenance), GitHub API Training (custom integrations), and comprehensive GitHub Actions curriculum spanning fundamentals to intermediate levels. Security-focused training covers GitHub Advanced Security developer training, security team training, code security, secret protection, supply chain security, and specialized CodeQL query writing.

Pricing for Expert Services training ranges approximately $3,000-8,000 per session depending on duration, customization, and delivery model (remote versus on-site). For ASTRA's 30-user deployment, recommended training package includes GitHub for Developers ($5,000) for core team, GitHub Admin Training ($5,000) for 2-3 administrators, and GitHub Actions Training ($5,000) for CI/CD implementation, totaling $15,000 first-year investment. Organizations purchasing Advanced Security should add GHAS Developer Training ($6,000), bringing comprehensive training to $21,000. This investment amortizes across multiple years as foundational knowledge, with subsequent years requiring only new hire onboarding and advanced topic refreshers costing $3,000-5,000 annually.

**Premium Plus Support uniquely includes one Expert Services training session annually**, representing $5,000 value offsetting higher support costs. For organizations scaling to 50+ users where Premium Plus becomes cost-justified, this included training covers ongoing team development, new feature adoption, or specialized topics like Copilot optimization or Advanced Security tuning. Training selection rotates across GitHub's 13-course catalog accommodating 16-25 participants per session, sufficient for most organizational needs.

Hybrid training strategy proves most effective for government adoption. Phase 1 (months 1-2) deploys GitHub Skills and Microsoft Learn self-paced courses to all users building foundational knowledge at zero cost, requiring 4-8 hours per person. Phase 2 (months 2-3) delivers Expert Services training to core teams and administrators, concentrating budget on roles requiring deep expertise. Phase 3 (months 4-6) extends advanced training to additional cohorts as organizational maturity grows. Ongoing maintenance uses free resources for new hires while budgeting $3,000-5,000 annually for specialized topics or refresher sessions keeping teams current with platform evolution.

## Migration pathways from existing version control systems

**GitHub Enterprise Importer provides free automated migration** for Enterprise Cloud customers, supporting Azure DevOps, Bitbucket Server/Data Center, GitHub Enterprise Server, and organization-to-organization migrations on GitHub.com. The tool migrates repositories with complete history, issues, pull requests, releases, attachments, and collaboration context at approximately 70 seconds per repository on average. CLI interface enables bulk migrations scripting repository lists, while API access supports advanced automations integrating with existing tooling.

Migration process follows planning → execution → validation workflow. Organizations conduct unlimited trial migrations testing process without affecting production systems, enabling iterative refinement before production cutover. Distinct migration permissions roles separate migration operators from regular administrators, implementing least privilege principles. Repository size limits cap individual repositories at 40GB Git content and 40GB metadata, with 400MB per-file limits, accommodating vast majority of projects while flagging outliers requiring special handling.

**GitHub Actions Importer separately migrates CI/CD pipelines** from Jenkins, CircleCI, GitLab CI/CD, Azure DevOps, Bamboo, Bitbucket Pipelines, and Travis CI to GitHub Actions. The tool analyzes existing pipeline configurations, translates syntax to GitHub Actions workflows, identifies required third-party actions from GitHub Marketplace, and generates migration reports forecasting effort. Public beta status indicates ongoing development with GitHub adding features based on customer feedback. Automated translation accelerates CI/CD migration compared to manual workflow recreation, though complex pipelines require human review and adjustment post-migration.

Organizations with straightforward migrations from supported platforms should utilize GitHub Enterprise Importer self-service approach, assigning 1-2 technical staff for 2-3 weeks. Trial migrations extensively test before production cutover, validating repository content, permission mappings, and collaboration history preservation. **GitHub Expert Services migration assistance costs approximately $15,000-40,000 for professional guidance**, recommended for complex multi-system migrations, unsupported source platforms (legacy systems, custom tools), large repository counts exceeding 1,000, or organizations lacking internal bandwidth for self-service migration.

Third-party migration partners including InfoMagnus, ReleaseTEAM, Coveros, Eficode, and Consulting Excellence Inc. provide alternative professional migration services, particularly valuable for GitLab migrations (not yet supported by GitHub Enterprise Importer) or organizations requiring vendor independence from GitHub-provided services. Partner pricing varies by project scope, with competitive bidding recommended for large engagements. However, GitHub-provided tools and services benefit from direct platform integration and ongoing support unavailable from third parties.

**For ASTRA, self-service migration using GitHub Enterprise Importer represents recommended approach** if migrating from Azure DevOps, Bitbucket, or GitHub Enterprise Server. Budget 2-3 weeks of technical staff time with Executive Services migration as fallback if complexity exceeds expectations. Organizations migrating from GitLab, Perforce, or other unsupported platforms should immediately engage Expert Services or partners rather than attempting manual migration. Include migration costs of $0 (self-service) to $30,000 (professional services) in first-year budget planning alongside subscription and training investments.

## Premium Support service levels and escalation procedures

**Premium Support costs 15-25% of annual spend as percentage-based add-on**, negotiable to 12-18% for larger contracts or multi-year commitments. For ASTRA's 30-user Enterprise Cloud deployment at $7,560 annually, Premium Support costs approximately $1,361 at 18% negotiated rate. This investment delivers 24/7 support availability via web portal and phone callback on demand, replacing standard Enterprise support's email-only ticket system with constrained business hours.

Service Level Agreements provide contractual response commitments based on ticket priority. Urgent priority (production down, security incident) guarantees 30-minute initial response. High priority (significant functionality impaired, approaching deadline) commits 4-hour response. Normal priority (general usage questions, non-critical bugs) and Low priority (feature requests, documentation) both specify 48-hour response times. Initial response constitutes GitHub engineer acknowledgment and triage, not issue resolution which depends on problem complexity.

**Support entitlements limit which team members can submit tickets**, with Premium including 20 designated individuals able to open support requests. Organizations name support entitlement holders during setup, typically including administrators, DevOps leads, security team members, and key developers. This constraint prevents support system flooding with novice user questions better addressed through documentation or internal training. Premium Plus doubles entitlements to 40, accommodating larger organizations or broader support access patterns.

Premium content access provides exclusive training materials, implementation guides, and best practices documentation unavailable to standard support customers. Escalation management coordinates High and Urgent priority tickets requiring cross-functional GitHub engineering resources, with support engineers acting as single point of contact through resolution. Priority ticket handling places Premium customers ahead of standard support queue, reducing wait times during high-volume periods. However, Premium Support explicitly excludes third-party integration troubleshooting (Jenkins, Jira, Azure DevOps), custom script writing, detailed SAML configuration, open source project support, and preview feature issues.

**Premium Plus elevates support with dedicated Customer Reliability Engineer** familiar with organizational environment, providing personalized rather than pooled support engineer experience. Quarterly automated health checks proactively identify configuration issues, performance bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities before they impact operations. Twelve technical advisory hours per quarter enable proactive consultation on capacity planning, upgrade strategies, workflow optimization, and architecture decisions. Application upgrade assistance provides environment-specific guidance, upgrade playbooks, and review of migration plans before major version transitions.

Premium Plus includes one annual Expert Services training session (choice of 13 courses for 16-25 participants, $5,000 value), offsetting higher support costs through reduced separate training expenditure. For organizations scaling beyond 50 users where dedicated support engineering becomes valuable, Premium Plus represents better value than Premium Support plus separate training purchases. ASTRA should begin with Premium Support at 30 users, evaluating Premium Plus upgrade when scaling toward 70 users or after first year if support ticket volume and technical advisory needs justify increased investment.

## Recommended implementation roadmap for ASTRA

**Phase 1 foundation establishment spans months 1-2** focusing on account setup and basic configuration. ASTRA should provision GitHub Enterprise Cloud with EU data residency, selecting Western Europe Azure region for optimal Swiss latency. Configure organizational structure using single unified organization rather than department-separated organizations, establishing teams for major functional areas: Governance, Documentation-Editors, IT-Operations, and Project-Teams with nested sub-teams for specific initiatives. Implement repository naming convention `[department]-[project]-[type]` documented in organizational wiki, with default repository visibility set to Internal balancing collaboration and confidentiality.

Enable Enterprise Managed Users connecting to Swiss government identity provider via SAML SSO, implementing SCIM provisioning for automated user lifecycle management. Configure IP allow lists restricting access to office networks and approved VPN endpoints, with backup administrators from different locations preventing lockout scenarios. Require two-factor authentication across enterprise with hardware security key mandate for administrator and privileged accounts, disabling less secure SMS authentication method. Establish basic branch protection rules on main branches requiring pull request reviews and signed commits, refining after team familiarization with workflow.

**Phase 2 security hardening occurs during months 3-4** after teams gain GitHub familiarity. Enable GitHub Secret Protection across all repositories implementing push protection preventing credential exposure, configuring custom secret patterns for ASTRA-specific internal systems. Establish security campaigns remediating historical secret exposure from legacy repositories, prioritizing active projects before archival content. Configure audit log streaming to Swiss government SIEM infrastructure ensuring compliance with records retention requirements and enabling central security operations center visibility.

Evaluate GitHub Code Security adoption based on application security requirements and budget availability. Code Security at $8,640 annually for 24 active committers represents 114% premium over base Enterprise Cloud subscription, requiring cost-benefit analysis weighing prevented security incidents against budget impact. Organizations developing public-facing web applications, processing personally identifiable information, or handling sensitive federal data should strongly consider Code Security investment. Agencies managing primarily internal documentation and low-risk administrative systems may defer Code Security until application development expands.

**Phase 3 training and adoption spans months 2-6** overlapping with technical implementation. Deploy GitHub Skills self-paced training to all users during months 2-3, requiring completion of Introduction to GitHub, Markdown communication, and review pull requests courses (combined 3 hours per person). Schedule Expert Services training during months 3-4: GitHub for Developers for core 15-20 team members, GitHub Admin Training for 2-3 designated administrators, and GitHub Actions Training for 8-10 developers implementing CI/CD pipelines. Budget $15,000 total for these three sessions.

Establish internal GitHub champions program identifying 3-5 power users receiving advanced training who subsequently provide peer support reducing help desk load. Create internal knowledge base in dedicated documentation repository capturing ASTRA-specific policies, workflow patterns, troubleshooting guides, and organizational conventions. Schedule quarterly community of practice meetings where teams share implementations, discuss challenges, and align on evolving best practices. This grassroots adoption support proves equally valuable as formal training for sustained organizational change.

**Phase 4 optimization and scaling occurs months 7-12 and ongoing**. Conduct quarterly security configuration audits reviewing branch protection rules, team access permissions, repository visibility classifications, and Advanced Security alert remediation status. Implement repository templates for common project types (documentation, web application, API service, infrastructure code) pre-configured with appropriate CODEOWNERS files, branch protection, issue templates, and GitHub Actions workflows. Review and optimize GitHub Actions workflows migrating high-volume pipelines to self-hosted runners if cloud-hosted minute consumption becomes expensive.

Evaluate Premium Plus Support upgrade when user base exceeds 50 or after first year if quarterly technical advisory hours and proactive health monitoring would provide value. Assess Advanced Security expansion if initial Secret Protection proves valuable and application security posture requires code scanning investment. Consider GitHub Copilot evaluation for productivity enhancement, noting data residency considerations requiring review of Copilot's data processing model against Swiss government policies. Schedule annual comprehensive review of GitHub usage patterns, costs, and organizational maturity determining next evolution phase.

## Final recommendations for Swiss Federal Roads Office

**ASTRA should deploy GitHub Enterprise Cloud with EU data residency as primary recommendation**, providing optimal balance of compliance, capability, and cost for Swiss federal institution. This configuration satisfies Swiss Federal Data Protection Act requirements through Azure Western Europe region data residency, delivers FedRAMP Tailored authorization and ISO 27001 certification demonstrating mature security controls, eliminates infrastructure management overhead compared to Enterprise Server self-hosting, provides immediate access to GitHub Copilot and latest platform features, and scales seamlessly from 10 to 70+ users without architectural changes.

Initial 30-user deployment should include Premium Support ($1,361 annually at 18% rate) ensuring 24/7 availability with 30-minute response times for urgent incidents, though organizations may alternatively begin with standard Enterprise support upgrading after 6 months based on actual support needs. Invest $15,000 first year in three Expert Services training sessions (Developers, Admin, Actions) providing foundation for organizational adoption, supplemented with free GitHub Skills self-paced training for all users. Budget $7,560 base subscription plus $1,361 Premium Support plus $15,000 training totaling $23,921 first year, dropping to $8,921 subsequently absent training refreshers.

**Adopt GitHub Secret Protection immediately at deployment** given relatively modest $5,472 annual cost for 24 active committers, preventing credential exposure that could lead to security incidents far exceeding subscription cost. Defer GitHub Code Security until security requirements clearly justify $8,640 annual investment, recognizing some government agencies mandate application security scanning while others prioritize different controls. Organizations developing public-facing web applications should implement Code Security from deployment; agencies managing primarily documentation may defer indefinitely.

Implement GitHub Flow branching strategy with squash-and-merge for documentation repositories and most software projects, reserving more complex GitFlow only for applications requiring parallel version support or formal release cycles. Configure branch protection requiring two approvals including code owner review, signed commits, status check passage, and conversation resolution before merge. Establish CODEOWNERS files using team-based ownership patterns ensuring sustainable maintenance as individual team members transition roles.

**Utilize self-service GitHub Enterprise Importer for migration** from Azure DevOps, Bitbucket, or existing GitHub Enterprise Server, assigning 1-2 technical staff for 2-3 weeks with Expert Services migration ($20,000-30,000) as fallback if complexity exceeds internal capacity. Migrate documentation repositories first as low-risk pilot validating process before production application migrations. Deploy self-hosted runners on Swiss government cloud infrastructure for high-volume CI/CD pipelines or air-gapped environments, eliminating GitHub Actions minute consumption charges while maintaining execution environment control.

Scale to 70 users following same architecture, evaluating Premium Plus Support upgrade ($3,881 annually including $5,000 value training) when dedicated Customer Reliability Engineer and quarterly technical advisory hours provide value justifying cost increase. At 70-user scale with full Advanced Security, realistic annual cost reaches approximately $41,000 for Enterprise Cloud plus Premium Support plus Code Security, representing comprehensive government-grade software development platform with mature compliance posture, extensive collaboration capabilities, and AI-powered productivity tools positioning ASTRA for digital transformation success.
